#login.py is below and i was using some code from that too edit the one below it but there is a looping error in the second one and not the first based off of the same code

"""
This is just notes, I dont really understand the
 for remaining in range(lockout_time, 0, -1):
                print(f"  Try again in {remaining} seconds", end="\r")
                time.sleep(1)
well I understand the logic I just would never use it as i dont know it to that degree
I will add a Total attempts counter and make it so the time for lockout_time increases until eventually being a permanent lockout.
dont remember how to do that rn tho
